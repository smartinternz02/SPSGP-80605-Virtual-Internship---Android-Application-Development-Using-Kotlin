Project - Grocery Android App ( Project 2 )
This Project is a part of Google Supported Virtual Internship - Android App Development Using Kotlin. I have completed all 6 Modules of Self Learning.

As we can't remember everything, users frequently forget to buy the things they want to buy. However, with the assistance of this app, you can make a list of the groceries you intend to buy so that you don't forget anything.
